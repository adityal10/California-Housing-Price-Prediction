## Project Overview

The California housing price prediction project is designed to analyze and predict housing prices based on publicly available data. The main objectives include:

- Understanding the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Preparing data with appropriate feature engineering techniques.
- Building machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **California Housing Dataset** from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset). 

### Key Details:

- **Source:** California Census data.
- **Features:** Numeric features including median income, house age, population, and more.
- **Target:** Median house value (in 100,000s).

## Features

Below are the key features used in the project:

- `longitude` and `latitude`: Geographical coordinates of the area.
- `housing_median_age`: Median age of houses in the area.
- `total_rooms` and `total_bedrooms`: Total rooms and bedrooms in the area.
- `population`: Total population in the area.
- `households`: Total households in the area.
- `median_income`: Median income of the residents.
- `ocean_proximity`: Proximity of houses to the ocean (categorical).

## Modeling

The project involves the following steps for building and evaluating predictive models:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Feature scaling and transformation.
   - Encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualization of feature distributions.
   - Correlation analysis.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Implementing multiple regression models, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting Machines
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Metrics used:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
     - RÂ² Score
